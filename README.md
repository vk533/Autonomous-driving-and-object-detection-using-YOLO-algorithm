# Autonomous driving and object detection using YOLO algorithm
## YOLO
"You Only Look Once" (YOLO) is a popular algorithm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time. This algorithm "only looks once" at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. After non-max suppression, it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes.
